      restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.

      The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and
      have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally.

      The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices,
      making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Little Lemon opened in 1995 by two Italian brothers, Adrian and Mario.
      Despite the city's diversity, the two brothers recognized the lack of
      Mediterranean cuisine in Chicago, and were inspired to bring the flavors
      of their hometown in Italy to the people of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers continue to oversee the Little Lemon restaurant, nearly
      thirty years later.
